# kmeans_as_a_set_of_functions
Implemented a basic k means clustering algorithm, ideally as a set of functions. Run it on Loan Prediction dataset and demonstrated it with a simple visualization of results.

This is implemented without use of any machine learning packages such as scikit- learn or any other packages
